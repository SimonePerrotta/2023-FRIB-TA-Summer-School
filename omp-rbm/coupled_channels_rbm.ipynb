    "# RBM emulator for coupled channels scattering\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to construct an emulator for a toy problem for inelastic nucleon-nucleus scattering in which we explicitly include a few excited states of the target in our model space. We will use a simple model with two excited states, with Woods-Saxon form factors on the diagonal, and Gaussian off the diagonal.\n",

    "In this toy model, the real part of the Woods-Saxon in the $n$th diagonal represents the interaction of the projectile and target in the $n$th excited state, with $n=0$ being the ground state (and, therefore, the elastic channel). The imaginary component represents the transition from the $n$th channel to other excited states not explicitly included in the model space ($n$ > 2). The off-diagonal terms represent coupling between channels, with $\\beta$ controlling the strength of coupling of the ground state to each excited state, and $\\gamma$ between excited states.\n",
